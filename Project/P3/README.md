# **Project - Part 3: Ranking**

## How to run the code

These are the steps needed to execute the code:

1. Download the file  **IRWA-2022-u172769-u172801-part-3.ipynb** located in this directory and the **data folder** of the parent directory (Project).
2. Put the .ipynb file and folder in a **Google Drive directory**.
3. Make sure you have all the necessary libraries to run the code (if you don't have them, download them in a cell by doing **pip install ...** ):

4. Identify where you have the data folder located and **change the file_name variables** for the JSON and the map:

5. Run all the cells one by one or run the command **Ctrl+F9** to run all the code.
6. You can change BM25 ranking parameters and OwnScore paremeters changing the default values or passing values when you call the functions:

7. We provide different code cells to test each of our ranking methods, introduce the query in the input box as in this example:
